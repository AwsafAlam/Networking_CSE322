Wormhole attack is a networking attack.

Its is possible in mobile adhoc networks and wireless sensor networks.
It is one of those kinds of severe attacks.
Wormhole is possible even if the attacker has not compromised on any host, and even if all communication authenticity and confidentiality.

In wormhole, attacker records packets at own location in the network, tunnelling them to another location, and retransmit them into the network.

So even cryptographic algo cannot detect it. So most of these affect wireless networks

mostly deployed in linked layer and ARP

1. Changes in AODV.h

#define ACTIVE_ROUTE_TIMEOUT    30				// 50 seconds

Changed from 10 to 30 seconds ( increase in active route timeout will cause the route to be deleted later. So, there
will be less update req sent. )

Dis adv : Also slow down link fail detection. since it willhave towait for aa greater activetimeout to realize packet is not forwarded anymore

/* Various constants used for the expanding ring search */
#define TTL_START     5
#define TTL_THRESHOLD 7
#define TTL_INCREMENT 2 

Modified
/* Various constants used for the expanding ring search */
#define TTL_START     3
#define TTL_THRESHOLD 7
#define TTL_INCREMENT 2 

Start with an initial small value, so there is even less overhead.
We are assuming dst probably hasn't moved far. this willl be more effective in case of 802.15.4
